> "The Epson EB-X100 is one of the best projectors I have ever used. It is very easy to set up and use, and it produces an amazing picture quality. The colors are rich and accurate, and the brightness is enough to fill my living room wall with a stunning image. The projector also has a very low fan noise, which does not bother me at all. The USB Display function is very convenient, as I can just plug in my laptop and start projecting without any hassle. The projector also supports HDMI input, which I use to connect my Blu-ray player and watch movies in high definition. The projector also has a built-in speaker that sounds surprisingly good for its size. The only thing I wish it had was a higher resolution, as some text and details can look pixelated at times. However, this is not a major issue for me, as I mainly use it for watching videos and photos. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and I would highly recommend this projector to anyone looking for a great value for money." - User review on Dimensidata.com
